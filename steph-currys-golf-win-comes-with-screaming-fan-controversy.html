That’s the way it is. Stupid cowards.”</p><p>Curry was able to take advantage of the situation <a href=#>with a clutch eagle putt</a> to overtake Fish and claim his first ACC tournament crown.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/NYPICHPDPICT000014175005.jpg><p>“You have to acknowledge it, it was an unfortunate situation,” Curry told reporters after the tournament.</p><p>“A guy trying to sabotage what was going on for a moment. Mardy is such a class act. I complimented him for the way he bounced back to give himself a chance to win.”</p><p>If Fish, who had parred 18 the first two days of the tournament, had birdied he would have been tied Curry with 75 points and the two would’ve headed for a playoff.</p><p>“Congrats stud,” Fish tweeted at Curry afterwards.</p><p>It is unclear if the fan was caught.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/07/NYPICHPDPICT000014175615.jpg><p>“I felt embarrassed for all the other fans,” Curry said. “There’s so much great love from the 99.9% of the people who come into this environment. And they’re so supportive and bring so much energy. You got one guy who loses his mind for a second.”</p><p>Despite the controversial ending, it was a week full of highlights for the star Warriors guard.</p><p>On Friday, he made an incredible sidewinding putt and followed that up <a href=#>with a hole in one on Saturday.</a></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>“I’ve always dreamt of a situation like this on an 18th green in front of a crowd like that to make a putt,”&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Curry told NBC Sports</a>. “You just stick to the routine. Have so much confidence in yourself and live with the results. Thankfully it went in, which is insane. Been playing in this thing for almost a decade and to finally get a win it’s pretty special.”</p><p>Jets quarterback Aaron Rodgers finished fifth while defending champion Tony Romo ended in eighth place.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bmam9fqMGmvMdmmq6qoq7AbrPOpZ1mr5mjeqS7zJ6qZq%2BZqbVuv8KrnJqlmaO0brLAp2Scp56pv7DCxKuqsmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-castaneda-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Castaneda Net Worth Phone Number, House Address, Wiki</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./molly-mae-hague.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Molly-Mae Hague-Tommy Fury's girlfriend and former Love Islander's net worth is $2.5 million!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ban-do-the-gioi-va-ban-do-6-chau-luc-the-gioi-phong-to.html>Bn Th Gii &amp;amp; Cc Chu Lc Phng To 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jodi-lyn-okeefe-movies-and-tv-shows.html>Jodi Lyn OKeefe Movies and TV Shows: Celebrity Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./soulja-boy-net-worth.html>Soulja Boy Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-shill-bidding-is-ruining-the-sports-card-hobby.html>How Shill Bidding is Ruining the Sports Card Hobby</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-painkiller-on-netflix-a-true-story.html>Is Painkiller on Netflix a true story?
