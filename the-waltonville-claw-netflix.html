He wonders if the truth was worth it in the end.</p><p>The episode focuses on a couple, Davis and Pia, traveling to Loch Henry to work on a documentary about egg theft. But along the way, they pivot to a local story about a killer, Iain.</p><p>Iain is shown as a killer who tortured and murdered eight people in the area, including Davis's father, policeman Kenny.</p><p>He was shot by Iain when he went to check on him. Shortly after the injury, he passed away due to contracting an illness while in the hospital.</p><p>Pia wanted to make a documentary about the killer and murders. And although Davis denied the suggestion concerning his father's 'death' he ultimately agreed.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.mixedarticle.com/uploads/posts/7c15b50e-2f77-4931-9363-09b67396ba8b/black-mirror-loch-henry-ending-explained.webp></p><p>Later in the film, when Davis is in the hospital, Pia discovers that Iain was actually aided by Davis' parents, Kenneth and Janet.</p><p>They were the ones using him and his home to conduct torture and murder. After realizing the truth, Pia is terrified and tries to go back to town. Soon, Janet finds out Pia knows the truth.</p><p>Pia manages to get away from Janet and runs away. And while crossing the river in the dark, she slips and drowns.</p><p>Janet returns home, retrieves all the evidence of her and her husband's crimes on the kitchen table, and commits suicide.</p><p>We learn that Kenneth killed Iain and his family before dramatically shooting himself. Ironically, the injury led to his demise.</p><p>Cut to an unspecified time later, a trailer for the documentary is released. Loch Henry: Truth Will Out also wins the BAFTAS, which is accepted by Historik Productions producer Kate.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.mixedarticle.com/uploads/posts/7c15b50e-2f77-4931-9363-09b67396ba8b/loch-henry-davis-mccardle.webp></p><p>Back in the hotel room, Davis receives a call from Stuart, who is on cloud nine about the award and the tourism the documentary has brought back to their town.</p><p>Meanwhile, Davis is left traumatized by the truth as he sits with his mother's note, staring at his award, left to wonder if the truth was worth it all in the end.</p><p>Viewers are quite thrilled about the <a href=# rel=noopener>Loch Henry</a> ending, with one individual writing, "What an episode.... even better than the first one... beautiful scenery and dark ending."</p><p>"The note at the end was poignant. I think it shows a mother's love for her son endures to the very end. She wanted to see him success, despite all that happened," another added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilma2ypa3RraCcpJVjsLC5jq2fnmWnlrm1u82voKWklWKwra3WZqWerJahtrk%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nivine-jay-ethnicity-ethnicity-parents-age-height.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jason Nash Fiance, Nivine Jay Ethnicity Parents Age And Height</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./el-chapo-para-que-regreses-lyrics-english-translation.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>El Chapo Para Que Regreses Lyrics English Translation</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ban-do-the-gioi-va-ban-do-6-chau-luc-the-gioi-phong-to.html>Bn Th Gii &amp;amp; Cc Chu Lc Phng To 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jodi-lyn-okeefe-movies-and-tv-shows.html>Jodi Lyn OKeefe Movies and TV Shows: Celebrity Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./soulja-boy-net-worth.html>Soulja Boy Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-shill-bidding-is-ruining-the-sports-card-hobby.html>How Shill Bidding is Ruining the Sports Card Hobby</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-painkiller-on-netflix-a-true-story.html>Is Painkiller on Netflix a true story?
