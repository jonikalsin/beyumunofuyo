Bay announced the news with a couple of photos from the wedding.</strong></p><p>The first was a black-and-white photograph of Bay and Smith walking together while confetti fell from the sky and Smith appeared to be delighted. In the second image, the couple exchanged glances against a backdrop of low summer light and a few trees.</p><h2>Lucy Smith is a concert promoter</h2><p>Nothing is known about Lucy Smith’s personal life at this time. So far, all that is known about Smith is that she works as a music promoter in London. Smith rose to prominence as James Bay’s longtime love, and the two had been together since Bay was 17. Smith, according to Bay, is the greatest guy on the planet, and inspired him to pursue a career in music. They were good friends before they became romantically involved. Furthermore, Bay stated:</p><p><strong>“Hang on, if you want to be a great artist one day, surely you should be out in some bar or club performing some songs right now,” she recalls. She instilled it in me, and I followed through on it. If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t be here.”</strong></p><p>In May 2022, Bay released his song, One Life, which detailed the path of him and Smith falling in love and raising their child together. James explained that he and Lucy grew up in the same town and that keeping their relationship private was important to them. He described One Life as a celebration of their journey thus far.</p><h2>A Look Back at James Bay’s Career</h2><p>James Bay released his first EP, The Dark of the Morning, in July 2013, followed by his second EP, Let It Go, in May 2014. The latter dominated both the iTunes album chart and the UK charts. James released his debut studio album, Chaos and the Calm, in December 2014, and his song, Hold Back the River, was charting in the UK. Other Sides, his fourth EP, was released in January 2015, and he recorded covers for Hey Bulldog and King’s Highway.</p><p>The 31-year album, old’s Electric Light, was released in May 2018, and the album’s tracks were instant hits. Oh, My Messy Mind, his third EP, was released in May 2019, and work on his third studio album began in the spring of 2020. His next single, Chew On My Heart, will be released in July 2020.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
