He has also played in various series like&nbsp;Band of Brothers, Peaky Blinders, and Wuthering Heights.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Hardy is an attractive man. It is not just&nbsp;his handsome looks and muscular body but the&nbsp;slew of tattoos adorning his body that people would have to look twice to understand.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tom Hardy and His Tattoos</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>There are around <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">30 tattoos</a>&nbsp;on his body which Hardy does not regret getting. These&nbsp;questionable designs have a special meaning to him&nbsp;—&nbsp;be it related to memorable moments,&nbsp;people, or losing bets.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Here is a list of inks decorating Hardy's body and the reason behind it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Leo Knows&nbsp;All&nbsp;</h3><p>Hardy got 'Leo Knows All' inked&nbsp;after losing a bet to <a href=# rel=follow>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. The bet was regarding Oscars, where Hardy believed DiCaprio would not win one for&nbsp;The&nbsp;Revenant.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Unfortunately for him, DiCaprio bagged the Academy Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role for the movie, and Hardy had to get the tattoo. However, Hardy was not hesitant to get the ink done, and now it sits on his arm.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Tattoos For&nbsp;to His Wife, Charlotte Riley</h3><p>The actor got married to his current wife, Charlotte Riley, in 2014. Since then, he has had two inks dedicated to her. One is 'Charlotte' tattooed on his shoulder, whereas the other is Riley's portrait adorning the left side of his back.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><h3>Leprechaun and Tribal Pattern&nbsp;</h3><p>Hardy got his first tattoo when he was 15. He got a leprechaun inked on his right arm as an&nbsp;homage to his Irish heritage. He later covered it with tribal patterns.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tattoos Dedicated to His Ex-Wife, Sarah Ward</h3><p>Hardy has a couple of designs on his body as an ode to his ex-wife Sarah Ward. The pair were married for almost a decade, from 1999 to 2008.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He has a dragon tattooed on his left biceps that denotes the birth year of Ward.&nbsp;He has also inked 'Till I die SW' on his abdomen in old English font and a 'W' on his&nbsp;right bicep.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tattoos Dedicated to His Son, Louis&nbsp;</h3><p>Hardy has two tattoos as an ode to his son. He has 'LH' written on his left arm and has a star inked on his left shoulder. He got the star after finding out Rachel Speed was pregnant with Louis.&nbsp;</p><p>Hardy and Speed started dating after the actor's first marriage ended, and the pair were together for four years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The actor also has 'Figlio mio bellissimo' and 'Padre Fiero,' which means 'My son is gorgeous' and 'Proud Father'&nbsp;respectively, in Italian.&nbsp;</p><h3>Marine Corps</h3><p>Hardy was not in the Marines, but his best friend's father was. Unfortunately, he died while serving for the country.</p><p>Therefore, as an homage to him, the actor has&nbsp;'his Marine Corps number 1338046' written near his collarbone on the right side.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h3>Lindy King</h3><p>A woman by the name of Lindy Kind had promised Hardy that she would get him into Hollywood. He had promised back that he would get her name tattooed.</p><p>Now, Hardy is one of the most sought-after actors in the industry and has 'Lindy King' etched on his arm.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3>Portrait of Madonna&nbsp;</h3><p>The actor has a massive body art of Madonna, Jesus' mother, on his body. This symbolizes motherhood and has a deeper meaning in Hardy's life.&nbsp;</p><p>The art denotes the actor "being able to mother" his parents, son, and&nbsp;himself.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h3>Pitbull</h3><p>Hardy has a sketch of a Pitbull (the breed, not the singer) on the left side of his back. It is dedicated to his pet, Muzzle.&nbsp;</p><h3>Tattoos Dedicated to Movies</h3><p>The actor has a raven inked on the left side of his chest, dedicated to&nbsp;Mad Max and The Dark Knight Rises. Similarly, he also has an angry wolf on his left forearm, denoting his role in The Revenant.</p><h3>Other Tattoos</h3><p>Some other tattoos of Hardy include&nbsp;feathers, Union Jack, birds, cards, skull,&nbsp;sacred heart, crosses, comedy and tragedy masks, and a scorpion, among others.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKyfonqprdGdsGaskanBsLvSZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rhoa-nene-leakes-not-quitting-the-real-housewives-of-atlanta.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>RHOA: Marlo Hampton Reveals Whether NeNe Leakes Will Return For Another Season</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hayley-williams-dye-job.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hayley Williams Unfavorite Dye Job Made Her Look Like Ghost</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ban-do-the-gioi-va-ban-do-6-chau-luc-the-gioi-phong-to.html>Bn Th Gii &amp;amp; Cc Chu Lc Phng To 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jodi-lyn-okeefe-movies-and-tv-shows.html>Jodi Lyn OKeefe Movies and TV Shows: Celebrity Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./soulja-boy-net-worth.html>Soulja Boy Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-shill-bidding-is-ruining-the-sports-card-hobby.html>How Shill Bidding is Ruining the Sports Card Hobby</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-painkiller-on-netflix-a-true-story.html>Is Painkiller on Netflix a true story?
