Their needs have to be met. But so do (the needs of those who) want to enjoy green open space. We don’t have a lot of it left.”</p><p>Several AYSO supporters, meanwhile, extolled the virtues of soccer as a welcoming youth program in which, famously, “everyone plays.”</p><p>“South Huntington Beach AYSO serves 1,600 kids a year with over 200 volunteers,” said Region 56 commissioner Ann McCarthy. “All kids play, regardless of skill and ability. But we have fewer fields than any other (Orange County) city of comparable size.”</p><p>Before the heartfelt testimonials began, city staff already had gone back to the drawing board – hastily affixing an alternative conceptual plan to the agenda. “Option C”&nbsp; rubbed out 57 parking spaces, which would rescue some 20 large trees.</p><p>“After the agenda came out, we heard a lot of concerns from neighbors,” said Chris Slama, director of community services for Huntington Beach. “We wanted to be responsive.”</p><p>At the end of the long meeting, the council unanimously approved the revised rendering.</p><p>“Thank you for listening to residents and making some changes,” Councilman Erik Peterson told Slama.</p><p>The soccer field crisis started brewing in 2019, when Huntington Beach City School District decided to sell its site that once housed Gisler Middle School – shuttered in 1986, and later occupied by and Brethren Christian School. The 14-acre property on Srathmoor Lane holds two full-sized, lighted soccer fields – the only ones in Region 56.</p><p>On Oct. 19, the City Council unanimously OKed the development of a residential tract on the property. Brookfield Homes, which bought the land from the district for $42 million, plans to build 85 single-family houses there.</p><p>Brookfield has pledged $500,000 to find a different site for lit soccer fields.</p><p>Should the Edison Park conceptual plan survive as currently imagined, three 50-yard by 70-yard youth-sized soccer fields will be added to a strip of land along Hamilton Avenue. Owned by Southern California Edison, the grassy area sits underneath power lines.</p><p>Two more soccer fields would share grass with existing softball fields.</p><p>Option C also ditches the off-leash dog area.</p><p>The city promises to plant 200 trees, more than replenishing those that will be felled.</p><p>Even so, some grumble, it will take decades for the saplings to fill the shoes of the tall, shady veterans there today. Residents continue to complain on social media about the impending death of beautiful trees.</p><p>“The environmental impact is massive, and it’s going to have a huge ripple effect,” wrote one critic, listing the multiple bird species that nest or rest in the park.</p><p>In Tuesday’s meeting, Councilman Mike Posey argued that the city is “planning for future generations.”</p><p>“People say, ‘We don’t want those 50-year-old trees cut down,” he said. “But in 50 years, trees we plant now will be 50 years old.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnmanAbr%2FOnJqeql2rwG7A0Z6crGWRqXqmsMispqdloJa%2FrHnAp5tmrJiaerW%2BxJ6qZqWZnLW1edaipWg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./nina-santiago.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Nina Santiago</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donna-derrico-princess-leia-bikini-photo.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donna DErrico Stuns In Princess Leia Bikini: Photo Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ban-do-the-gioi-va-ban-do-6-chau-luc-the-gioi-phong-to.html>Bn Th Gii &amp;amp; Cc Chu Lc Phng To 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jodi-lyn-okeefe-movies-and-tv-shows.html>Jodi Lyn OKeefe Movies and TV Shows: Celebrity Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./soulja-boy-net-worth.html>Soulja Boy Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-shill-bidding-is-ruining-the-sports-card-hobby.html>How Shill Bidding is Ruining the Sports Card Hobby</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-painkiller-on-netflix-a-true-story.html>Is Painkiller on Netflix a true story?
