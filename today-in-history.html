One of his most enduring legacies is the conservation of natural lands, as Roosevelt protected some 230 million acres during his time in office.</p><h2>1929: Mother Teresa Arrives In Kolkata, India</h2><p>A young nun born Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu, later known as <a href=# rel=noopener>Mother Teresa</a>, arrives in Kolkata, India.
