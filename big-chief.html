Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Jackie has established a name for herself in the racing world since she started racing at the age of eight, and her success has only increased her net worth to <strong>$1 million.</strong></p><h2><span id=Where_was_Big_Chief_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Big Chief born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Without Big Chief, there would be no “Street Outlaws”; he is now the go-to man if you want to race and are from Oklahoma. Big Chief was born on <strong>December 9, 1980</strong>, in Louisville, Kentucky, but moved to Oklahoma when he was 12 years old. He developed an interest in vehicles when he was nine years old and would ride his bike to Route 66 to watch drivers compete in street racing.</p><h2><span id=Is_Big_Chief_Married_Relationship>Is Big Chief Married? Relationship</span></h2><p>Big Chief had been married before; he met his ex-wife, Alice, when he was only 18 years old. Corbin and Covil Shearer, the couple’s two sons, were born on September 29, 2006. Unfortunately, their marriage deteriorated over time, resulting in their divorce in 2017. Big Chief has only been with Jackie since then, and he has stated that she is his future, so perhaps another wedding ceremony is on the horizon.</p><h2><span id=How_did_Big_Chief_start_his_Professional_Career>How did Big Chief start his Professional Career?</span></h2><p>With each passing day, Jackie’s passion for racing grew stronger, and she eventually decided to pursue racing as a career. She eventually purchased a Spitzer Dragster and is now a member of the Rocket Brand Race Fuel Bracket Series and Super Pro. Her skills gradually improved, and she won several tournaments, earning her the title of Car Chix girl for May 2015.</p><p>Despite her many accomplishments, it was her affair with Big Chief that made her famous. Despite the fact that he was married, he allegedly fell in love with Jackie almost immediately and the two became a couple.</p><p>Big Chief, Justin Shearer, divorced in 2017, and the two are now spending time together. Because of this connection, Jackie received a lot of attention, mostly negative because she was chastised for dating a married man, but also positive because of her success and notoriety as a racer. Anyway, since she and Big Chief began dating, she’s become a celebrity.</p><p>His first car was a 1972 Pontiac LeMans, which was also his dream car. He was cast in the reality TV series “Street Outlaws” after winning numerous races and becoming increasingly successful. He has been named the head of the Oklahoma area and is the person to contact if you want to compete in the next race. Big Chief, like the other racers, appeared in all 362 episodes of the popular reality show, which catapulted him to international fame.</p><p>Big Chief on Instagram has nearly 800,000 followers. He is also well-known on Twitter, where he has approximately 80,000 followers. He has used his celebrity to promote his most recent professional accomplishments, but he has also published personal information, such as photos of his children.</p><p><span style=font-size:18pt data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely"}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":301440,"10":2,"11":0,"14":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"15":"Arial","18":1,"21":1}' data-sheets-hyperlink=https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/ data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":1136076},"9":1}}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/without-a-partner-lori-petty-feels-lonely/"}{"1":54}'><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Also Read: </a><a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Without A Partner, Lori Pretty Feels Lonely</a></span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>Car Racer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Who Is Hollie Doyle?
