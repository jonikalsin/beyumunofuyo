Thus, we present you this “RJ Miller Bio,” exploring his life.</span></p><h3><b>RJ Miller On Life Below Zero: New Generation</b></h3><p><span>National Geographic channel’s </span><i><span>Life Below Zero: Next Generation</span></i><span> returned for its fourth installment on January 18, 2022, and there appeared RJ alongside his dad all ready to flaunt their teamwork.</span></p><p><span>Well, if you’re a longtime fan of the show, you know the deal — the father-son duo faced the freezing winters in Alaska, trying to provide food for themselves, or in their case — for the village elders as well.</span></p><p><span>Wealth has always been sharing food with the community, and the duo took pride in hunting to provide food for those who were unable to. So, viewers can expect a lot of hardships from the father-son; especially when they have a lot of mouths to feed.</span></p><p><span>Joining RJ this season were his co-stars — Sonta and <a href=#>Chevie Roach</a> (who teaches their children survival skills), Johnny Rolfe (who looks for food in the new territory), Kaleb and <a href=#>Brittany Rowland</a> and their children, Gilbert and Elovie (who complete necessary building projects), Alex Javor, and the husband-wife Jessi and Chris Morse who defends their home.</span></p><h3><b>RJ Miller Age</b></h3><p><span>RJ Miller was 25 years of age when he appeared on </span><i><span>Life Below Zero: New Generation</span></i><span> in 2022.</span></p><p><span>His dad <a href=#>Robert</a> 49 then.
