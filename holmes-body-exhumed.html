The structure was designed by serial murderer Herman Webster Mudgett (better known by his alias H.H. Holmes), a pharmacist who built the structure to lure his, mostly female, victims from the World’s Columbian Exposition, then occurring in Chicago. The interior was a mazelike, with rooms for torturing his captive victims, as well as both a lime pit and furnaces in the basement, which were used to dispose of the bodies.

It wasn’t until he murdered his business partner that police uncovered the rest of his crimes and finally arrested him.</p><a href=#><img decoding=async alt="Hh Holmes Podcast" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img//thumb/300.megaphone.imgix.net/podcasts/a38748c6-99e1-11ee-8c9a-3f9a425605dd/image/HH-Holmes-cover1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> History Uncovered Podcast Episode 98: The Truth Behind The Legend Of H. H. Holmes And His ‘Murder Castle’ Today, H. H. Holmes lives on in infamy as "America's First Serial Killer," but stories claiming he murdered as many as 200 may not be completely true.</a><p>Holmes was held at the Moyamensing Prison in Philadelphia to await his execution. It was there, rumors say, that he began to plan his escape.</p><p>A newspaper article <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published</a> by the Chicago Daily Inter-Ocean claimed that another man was executed under Holmes name, and that Holmes escaped — alive — in his own casket.</p><p>“Within two hours of the hanging an undertaker’s wagon containing a casket drove out of the prison yard,” the article stated. “That casket was supposed to contain the body of Holmes. Instead, it contained Holmes living.”</p><p>Holmes reputation as sly and cunning contributed to the rumors surrounding his death, as did the overly specific way he had planned his own burial.</p><p>Holmes had requested before his death that his casket be a “double-deep” pine coffin, filled with cement, buried 10 feet below the ground and covered with seven more 3,000 pound barrels of cement, an extra measure he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> was to “ensure his body against the vandalism or scientific curiosity of ghouls.”</p><p>Many believed it was an elaborate distraction from his escape.</p><p>However, despite the rumors, “<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">firsthand knowledge</a>” and theories about his death, the truth is finally out. H.H. Holmes has been buried safely beneath the ground and an excess of concrete for over a hundred years.</p><p>Whether that’s comforting or not depends, of course, on your theories as to who Jack the Ripper is.</p><p>Following the exhumation and forensic testing, Holmes body was reinterred at&nbsp;Holy Cross Cemetery in Yeadon, Pennsylvania.</p><p>Next, read about Hungary’s “<a href=#>vampire</a>” serial killer.
