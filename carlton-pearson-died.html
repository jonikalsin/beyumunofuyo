His life was filled with remarkable experiences and a unique spiritual journey that touched the hearts of many.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-104 data-inserter-version=2></span><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Was_Carlton_Pearson></span>Who Was Carlton Pearson?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Carlton Pearson was born and raised in San Diego, California. His early life was deeply rooted in the Pentecostal Christian tradition, a faith that would significantly shape his future endeavors. He attended Oral Roberts University in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where he majored in Bible literature and the English Bible. It was during his time at the university that he began his journey into the world of evangelism. Carlton Pearson served as an associate evangelist for the Oral Roberts Association and later became a member of the Oral Roberts University Board of Regents, where he served for 15 years. His dedication and contributions to the university were recognized with several honorary doctoral degrees.</p><p>In 1977, Pearson founded Higher Dimensions Inc., marking the beginning of his unique spiritual journey. The following year, he established a church in Tulsa, which quickly grew to 5,000 members who met weekly. This was a significant achievement, highlighting his ability to connect with and inspire a large congregation.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p>Pearson was not just a charismatic preacher; he was also an accomplished author. He wrote a variety of books and booklets, two of which were published by Simon and Schuster, further spreading his message of faith and inclusion. Beyond his own congregation, he sought to create a broader spiritual community through the Metacostal Network of Churches and Ministries. This network aimed to bridge the gap between his Pentecostal roots in spiritual transcendence and a more metaphysical approach to ministry and progressive spirituality.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Life_on_the_Big_Screen></span>A Life on the Big Screen<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Carlton Pearson’s extraordinary journey became the basis for a Netflix original movie titled “Come Sunday.” Produced by ENGAME and NPR</strong>, the film shines a light on Pearson’s transformation and the evolution of his ministry. <strong>Premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2018, “Come Sunday” is now available for viewers on Netflix.</strong> This movie captures the essence of his personal story, illustrating his transition to a doctrine of radical inclusion, which challenges the traditional Christian belief that only Christians will experience eternal life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Carlton_Pearson_Died_What_Happened_to_Him></span>Carlton Pearson Died: What Happened to Him?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Obnoxious Media regrets to inform you that Bishop Carlton Pearson, a prominent figure, has <a href=#>sadly passed away</a>.</strong> In 2001, he was diagnosed with cancer but was fortunate to be declared cancer-free shortly after his initial treatment.
