Like him, his wife is an actor. The couple met for the first time in 2003 while performing The Cherry Orchard by Anton Chekhov.</strong></p><p>Bonnar portrayed Trofimov, while Gaskell portrayed Dunyasha. While Bonnar and his wife cooperated in the production, neither of them appeared onstage. This did not prevent the two from meeting, though.</p><p>The pair dated for four years before getting married on December 28, 2007. There are few details concerning their wedding because neither Bonnar nor his partner has discussed it.</p><h2>Mark and Jennifer Bonnar are the parents of two children</h2><p>Four years after their wedding, Mark Bonnar and his wife welcomed their first child, Martha Bonnar, in July 2011. Bonnar acknowledged, when discussing parenthood, that he had always intended to become a father but did it later than others.</p><p>I was running out of time. I met Lucy when I was in my mid-thirties, and we dated for eight years before starting a family. Bonnar and Gaskell’s family grew in June 2015 when she gave birth to their son, Samuel Bonnar.</p><p>Even though he is constantly involved with performing, Bonnar still makes time for his children. He revealed to The Sunday Post that his and Gaskell’s work schedules were lucky.</p><p>We have filled each other’s professional voids. Lucy was in Nice a few weeks ago filming an episode of an American television series after I left Unforgotten.</p><h2>Who is the wife of Mark Bonnar?</h2><p>Lucy Gaskell is a British actor who graduated from the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama with a background in music and drama. The next year after earning her bachelor’s degree in 2001, she began her professional career.</p><p>Gaskell appeared in multiple television programs in 2002, including Where the Heart Is, Holby City, and Cutting It (2002–2004). She has starred in scores of films and television series since then.</p><p>Misfits (2012), Doctor Who (2007-2009), and The A Word are a few of her most renowned works (2017). Gaskell also appeared in Casualty from 2010 to 2011 as staff nurse Kirsty Clements. Her husband played a similar position as a nurse in the medical drama from 2005 to 2006.</p><p>In addition to her acting career, Gaskell is an ambassador for Women’s Aid, a non-profit organization dedicated to ending domestic abuse against women and children. In November 2018, Bonnar discussed his wife’s work with Women’s Aid on Instagram.</p><p>In addition, Gaskell provides voiceovers. Sue Terry Voices indicates that she produces voiceovers for, among other things, advertisements, documentaries, and audiobooks.</p><p>Crossing Lines (2013), Dark Minds (2014), Ransom (2016), A History of Paper (2016), and The Athena (2016) are but a few of the works she has narrated (2018).</p><p>Bonnar has also contributed his voice to a number of projects. In the 2013 video game Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag, he voiced the character Edward Thatcher, who was partially modeled on the notorious pirate Blackbeard.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Michael Voltaggio Dating?
