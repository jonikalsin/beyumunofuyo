Archie’s mother is Akiko Matsuura, a Japanese singer and drummer who has performed with various bands such as The Big Pink, Pre, and Comanechi. In this article, we will explore Archie’s life, his parents’ relationship, and his father’s career.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Archie’s Birth and Early Life</strong></h3><p>Archie Heaton was born on May 19, 2014, in London, England. His parents were both 20 years old when he was conceived, and they had met and fallen in love while playing together in the noise rock band Comanechi. However, their relationship did not last long, and they split up shortly after Archie’s birth. According to Biography Host, Archie went on to live with his mother in London, while his father moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting career. Archie holds British nationality and belongs to mixed ethnicity of British White and Asian Japanese.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Archie’s Relationship with His Father</strong></h3><p>Despite living apart, Archie and Charlie have maintained a close bond and visit each other regularly. Charlie has been very private about his son and does not share photos of him on social media. However, he occasionally mentions him in interviews and expresses his love and pride for him. For example, in an interview with GQ magazine, Charlie said that being a father at a young age was “incredible” and that Archie was “the best thing that ever happened” to him. He also said that he wanted to give Archie a “stable” and “normal” life.</p><p>Charlie also faced some challenges as a father, especially when he was denied entry to the US in 2017 after a small amount of cocaine was found in his luggage at the airport. This incident prevented him from attending the premiere of the second season of Stranger Things and caused him to miss some time with his son. However, he later apologized for the incident and said that it was a “mistake” and that he had learned from it.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Archie’s Mother: Akiko Matsuura</strong></h3><p>Akiko Matsuura is a talented musician who was born in Japan and moved to London when she was 18 years old. She is a singer and a drummer who has played with several bands, including The Big Pink, an electronic rock band that has toured with Muse and Arcade Fire; Pre, a noise rock band that has been compared to Sonic Youth and The Slits; and Sperm Javelin, a punk rock band that has a provocative name and style. She also has a solo project called Spermwhale, where she sings and plays guitar.</p><p>Akiko met Charlie when they were both teenagers and joined Comanechi, a band that was influenced by Nirvana, Bikini Kill, and The Melvins. They toured together in the UK and fell in love during that time. However, their romance did not last long after Archie was born, and they decided to part ways. According to USA Mirror, Akiko took responsibility when Charlie lost the case for child custody. However, they have remained on good terms and co-parent their son amicably.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Archie’s Father: Charlie Heaton</strong></h3><p>Charlie Heaton is a rising star who has made a name for himself as an actor and a musician. He was born on February 6, 1994, in Yorkshire, England. He moved to London when he was 16 years old and started his musical career as a drummer. He played with Comanechi for a while, then joined The Quietus, another noise rock band.</p><p>He later switched to acting and landed his breakthrough role as Jonathan Byers in Stranger Things, a sci-fi horror series that has become a global phenomenon. His character is the older brother of Will Byers, who goes missing after encountering a mysterious creature from another dimension called the Demogorgon. Charlie has received critical acclaim for his performance as Jonathan, who is a shy but brave teenager who helps his friends fight against the evil forces that threaten their town.</p><p>Charlie has also appeared in other films and TV shows, such as Shut In (2016), a thriller where he plays the son of Naomi Watts; Marrowbone (2017), a horror film where he plays the eldest of four siblings who hide a dark secret; The New Mutants (2020), a superhero film where he plays Samuel Guthrie/Cannonball, a mutant who can propel himself at high speeds; Soulmates (2020), an anthology series where he plays one of the people who use a test that can find their perfect match; and The Sandman (2021), an upcoming fantasy series based on the comic book by Neil Gaiman, where he plays John Constantine, a magician and occult detective.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Archie’s Future</strong></h3><p>Archie Heaton is a lucky kid who has two talented and loving parents who support him and care for him. He is also a smart and shy kid who has inherited his parents’ artistic genes. He might follow in their footsteps and pursue a career in music or acting, or he might choose a different path for himself.
