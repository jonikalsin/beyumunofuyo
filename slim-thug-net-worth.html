According to sources, Slim Thug’s net worth is estimated to be over $3 million,&nbsp; most of his wealth having been accumulated from his involvement in the music industry in a career now spanning almost 20 years.</p><h3>Slim Thug Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Slim Thug’s passion for rapping started when he was a teenager, and then at the age of 17 he took up performing rap at local parties. Shortly after that, Slim Thug was noticed by a rap group label called Swishahouse, founded by Michael 5000 Watts and OG Ron C, and signed a record deal with them. However, Slim Thug soon realized that he could survive without the help of the label, and he eventually left Swishahouse, and made his debut in the music industry in 2004, when <a href=#>Mike Jones</a> released “Still Tippin”, a collaboration between the two artists. “Still Tippin’” made it onto the music charts in the US, and quickly sold more than a million copies, which earned it a Platinum certification from the RIAA.</p><p>This debut began the rise of Slim Thug’s net worth, and shortly after this collaboration, he came out with his debut album called “Already Platinum”, which was released to generally positive reviews, featuring guest appearances from <a href=#>T.I.</a>, <a href=#>Jazze Pha</a>, <a href=#>Pharrell</a> and <a href=#>Pusha T</a>, and did extremely well on the market, as it peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200 chart and sold over 130,000 copies during its debut week; it has now sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide. The album spawned such singles as “Like a Boss”, which was parodied by “The Lonely Island” comedy group, “3 Kings” and “I Ain’t Heard of That”. His net worth was growing steadily.</p><p>In addition to his solo work and collaborations, in 2004 Slim Thug created a hip hop collective under the name of “Boss Hogg Outlawz”. The group released their debut album entitled “Boyz-n-Blue” that same year. Together with “Boss Hogg Outlawz”, Slim Thug has subsequently released three more studio albums, the latest one being “Serve & Collect III”. Although leader of the group, Slim Thug still did not abandon his solo career; in 2009, he came out with “Boss of All Bosses”, which was followed by his most recent album entitled “Tha Thug Show”, which was released in 2010. Around the same time, he made an appearance with several other artists’ tracks, including “Luxurious” with <a href=#>Gwen Stefani</a>, as well as <a href=#>Beyoncé’s</a> “Check It Out”, which topped the music charts. More recently, in 2013 he released his new <a title="Extended play" href=#>EP</a> entitled “Welcome to Texas” was released, featuring guest appearances from <a title="Pimp C" href=#>Pimp C,</a> <a title="Rick Ross" href=#>Rick Ross</a> and <a title=Ludacris href=#>Ludacris</a> among others.</p><p>In 2006, Slim Thug won the Best R & B Video Award for “Check On It”. All his work has added to his net worth.</p><p>In addition to music, Slim Thug also made an appearance on television screens, when in 2009 he guest starred on the late-night program hosted by <a href=#>Jon Stewart</a>, called “The Daily Show”.</p><p>In his personal life, Slim Thug is apparently still single, although in the past he was associated with singer <a href=#>LeToya Lucket</a>, and has supposedly fathered a child with another unnamed woman.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=17.471887550201><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Slim Thug</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$3 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>September 8, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Houston, Texas, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>6' 6" (1.98 m)</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>Profession</td><td>Rap artist, businessman, actor, rapper</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Dreux Mason</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Raymond Thomas</td></tr><tr readability=0.44444444444444><td>Facebook</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.facebook.com/slimthugbho</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/slimthugga</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.38297872340426><td>Instagram</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.instagram.com/hogglife101/</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.4><td>MySpace</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://myspace.com/slimthug</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>www.imdb.com/name/nm2265540</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.25806451612903><td>Allmusic</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://www.allmusic.com/artist/slim-thug-mn0000028406</a></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Awards</td><td>MTV Video Music Awards - Best R&B Video (2006)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Albums</td><td>Boss of All Bosses (2009), Already Platinum (2005), Boss Life (2013), Hogg Life: The Beginning (2015), Tha Thug Show (2010), Boss Hogg Outlaws (2001)</td></tr><tr readability=8><td>Nominations</td><td>BET Award for Best Collaboration, BET Award for Video of the Year, MTV Video Music Award – MTV2 Award, Chuuch, Still Tippin', Hogg Life</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>Movies</td><td>One Hit Wonderland (2016, documentary), Monkey in the Hood</td></tr><tr readability=5><td>TV Shows</td><td>Madden NFL 2006 (2005), Entourage (2005), Strictly Come Dancing (2014), The Daily Show (2009)</td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Soundtrack <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=soundtrack readability=6><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr readability=4><td>Strictly Come Dancing</td><td></td><td>TV Series performer - 1 episode, 2014 writer - 1 episode, 2014</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Death Race</td><td>2008</td><td>performer: "Click Clack" / writer: "Click Clack" - as Stayve Thomas</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>ATL</td><td>2006</td><td>performer: "I Ain't Heard of That" / writer: "I Ain't Heard of That" - as Stayve Thomas</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>The Pink Panther</td><td>2006</td><td>performer: "Check On It Pink Panther" / writer: "Check On It Pink Panther" - as Stayve Thomas</td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Madden NFL 2006</td><td>2005</td><td>Video Game performer: "Get It Started"</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Entourage</td><td>2005</td><td>TV Series 1 episode</td><td></td></tr></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor readability=1><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Red All Over</td><td>2015</td><td></td><td>KJ Wright</td></tr><tr><td>Beyoncé: No Angel</td><td>2013</td><td>Video short</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Days of Wrath</td><td>2008</td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr readability=2><td>Beyoncé Feat.
