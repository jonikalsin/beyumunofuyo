While he did confirm her claims that she’s expecting their child as well as the fact he paid for her IVF treatments, he insisted he was still very much a single man.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“I’m not in a relationship,” Choppa told host Lore’l. “Some people delusional. I am a free man. I am God’s creation. Don’t nobody own me. I ain’t got no cell block number. [Yeah, I paid for] IVF. I think she worded it wrong. I went through IVF because we previously had a miscarriage and that was pretty much my way of another chance at it in a sense.”</p><p>He continued: “But it was understood from the jump that I wasn’t in a relationship with no one. I just felt like – I don’t know. I ain’t never owed nobody nothing but I just felt kind of sorry if that makes sense. So I just wanted to try to make that situation right. And I’m still the asshole.”</p><p>The interview arrived just days after Marissa took to social media to publicly shame Choppa for not being there for her and their future child as he’s allegedly skipped several recent doctor appointments.</p><p>“I Really been trying to hold it down and keep it together,” she wrote in an Instagram Story. “But I’m honestly just fed tf up. You constantly trying to holla at folks, take folks on dates and etc but you have failed to show up for your child!</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“That YOU PAID FOR ME TO HAVE! You think because you may pay a doctor bill or send a few dollars for certain shit that changes the fact that you’re absent as fuck. I’ve had 31 appointments since we’ve placed our child in my stomach and you haven’t shown up to one.”</p><p>She continued: “You’re telling me, you don’t got no time for doctor’s appointments but you got time to wanna take folks on vegan dates? You got time to wanna continue to shoot your shot but not for your kid?? You got time to wanna fall in love with someone else.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2023/04/nle-choppa-gifts-lil-wayne-custom-chain-during-boston-tour-stop-250x142.jpg alt="NLE Choppa Gifts Lil Wayne Custom Chain During Boston Tour Stop" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>NLE Choppa Gifts Lil Wayne Custom Chain During Boston Tour Stop</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>April 19, 2023</p></a><p>The scathing posts came after NLE Choppa made <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>public attempts to holla at both Meagan Good </a>and <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Ice Spice – neither of which ended up successfully</a>.</p><p>“I really wish you was this active and supportive to do this with something else my n-gga,” Marissa wrote in response <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>to his most recent attempt</a>. “You starting to piss me off.”</p><p>In other news, <a href=# rel=noopener>NLE Choppa recently made his debut on Charlie Sloth’s Apple Music show Fire in the Booth</a>, going in over UK beats among the likes of Dave’s “Starlight” and Tion Wayne and Russ Millions’ “Body” – complete with a faux British accent.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>NLE Choppa released his new album, Cottonwood 2, last week.
