He is also known for his books and owns and operates a website, AreYouWhole.com.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Roberts’ endeavors have made him? As of early 2018, Roberts’ net worth is estimated to be as high as $3 million by authoritative sources.</p><h3>Toure Roberts Net Worth $3 Million</h3><p>Toure spent most of his childhood in Watts, California, and struggled in his early life, as the whole neighborhood was affected by criminal acts, and Toure feared for his life up to young adulthood. Thanks to his mother who was very supportive towards Toure, he managed to break out from his generation, which already had legal problems before their 18th birthday. He went to George Washington High School in Los Angeles, California, and after matriculation enrolled at California State University, Northridge, wanting to become a child psychologist. He started writing, also turning towards religion, and as early as 2002 founded his own church. According to his words, he received a word from God himself to start his own church, and that in no time he would gain thousands of followers. However, his start wasn’t quite successful, but thanks to his persistence and belief, his church began attracting followers. In no time, he had thousands of followers, and now every week his words are heard by those people. He has published a number of self-help books, including “Purpose Awakening: Discover the Epic Idea that Motivated Your Birth” (2014) – which quickly became a bestseller, increasing his net worth by a large margin – then “Wholeness: Winning in Life from the Inside Out” in 2018, the sales of which also added a decent amount to his net worth.</p><p>Thanks to his growing popularity, Toure has toured across the USA, speaking at significant gatherings, passing on his message of everyday improvement. He has also managed to transfer his influence online, thanks to his Instagram account on which he has more than 130,000 followers, while on Facebook he has over 110,000 followers, which have not only increased his popularity, but also his net worth.</p><p>In recent years, Toure also featured in the TV mini-series “A Pastor, a Rabbi and an Imam” (2016), which has five episodes, also contributing to his wealth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Toure has been married to Sarah Jakes since 2014; the couple has six children together. Sarah is the daughter of megachurch pastor TD Jakes.</p><p>Toure is also a well-known philanthropist; he started the Artist Resource Center, a non-profit organization which helps artists reach their full potential by providing them with tools and knowledge</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlanEsL7Toaeoq6RjvLOzjq2mrqqVYr%2BwrsSrq6xlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./woman-reveals-the-eerie-underground-bomb-shelter-she-discovered-in-a-california-home-built-in-1951.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Woman reveals the eerie underground BOMB SHELTER she discovered in a California home built in 1951</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./thomas-blanton-dead.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>KKK Member Convicted In 1963 Bombing Of Black Church Dies In Prison</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./ban-do-the-gioi-va-ban-do-6-chau-luc-the-gioi-phong-to.html>Bn Th Gii &amp;amp; Cc Chu Lc Phng To 2024</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jodi-lyn-okeefe-movies-and-tv-shows.html>Jodi Lyn OKeefe Movies and TV Shows: Celebrity Journey</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./soulja-boy-net-worth.html>Soulja Boy Net Worth</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./how-shill-bidding-is-ruining-the-sports-card-hobby.html>How Shill Bidding is Ruining the Sports Card Hobby</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./is-painkiller-on-netflix-a-true-story.html>Is Painkiller on Netflix a true story?
